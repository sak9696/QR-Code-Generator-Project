# QR-Code-Generator-Project
*QR code store the more information than BAR code. QR Code stores the information matrix form which 
stores the information on both axes horizontally or vertically.
* Thus we have also generated the QR Code of College data where we are embedded the details of the 
college like College Logo, Principals name, college mail address, postal address, etc..
* QR codes can store contents such as text, URL links, automatic SMS messages, or any other information 
that can be well-established in a two-dimensional barcode.
